                    Go through the concepts of investing and low risk content was personally boring because I already knew about it.

                    I still fell I don't have enough knowledge and base to make high risk investments in Finland. I had probably too high hopes 
                    in this intro and even if the team presented well and really knew about the subject, it didn't have enough time to caught up 
                    with my (maybe) deeper questions. I'm excited about angel investment, I believe it's a strong possibility after creating a solid product in the market.

                    I really liked the overview and example given by the intro team about stock. Tesla is a classic example to show supply versus demand. 
                    The quantity of cars made by Tesla anually doesn't match the quantity of people wishing to buy it. So even if the company is "new" and doesn't
                    have a very heavy portfolio, still, the stock value is higher than Toyota, a solid company in the market for years, heavely selling.

                  <p className="m-0 text-sm">
                    I didn't know the case of GameStop so it was nice to hear how much a trend can move the stock. I've seen it happening in 
                    crypto market but I didn't know it was possible in stock as well. It's scary to go all in an opportunity as GameStop where you 
                    can make tones of money in a day or also to loose a lot of money in few hours. As Ariel said, you need to be early enough in the trend.
